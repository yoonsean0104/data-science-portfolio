# NFL Touchdown Prediction Model in R

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the number of touchdowns by NFL players based on historical game statistics. Using R, a powerful statistical programming language, we build a model that analyzes past performance data to forecast future touchdown achievements.

## Motivation
The project is inspired by a passion for football and an interest in applying data science to sports analytics. Predicting player performance can aid coaches, fans, and fantasy football players in making informed decisions.

## Technologies Used
- **R**: The primary programming language for statistical analysis and data visualization.
- **Tidyverse**: A collection of R packages designed for data science.
- **Caret**: A package providing simple and efficient tools for data splitting, pre-processing, model training, model tuning, and model evaluation.
- **RandomForest**: An ensemble method for classification and regression tasks.
- **Readr**: Part of the tidyverse, used for reading and writing data.

## Technical Aspect
This project includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the NFL dataset for analysis.
- **Model Building**: Using the Random Forest algorithm to create a predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy in predicting touchdowns.
- **Insights**: Providing insights into player performance and model effectiveness.

## Impact of This Project
The touchdown prediction model offers valuable insights into player performance, enhancing strategic decision-making in team management, fantasy football, and betting industries.
