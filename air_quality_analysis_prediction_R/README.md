# Air Quality Analysis and Prediction in R

## Overview
This R project involves sophisticated analysis and prediction of air quality levels using historical data. By employing `tidyverse`, `dplyr`, `dbplyr`, and machine learning techniques, it aims to uncover patterns in air pollution and predict future conditions.

## Motivation
Given the increasing concern over air pollution and its health impacts, this project seeks to utilize data science in understanding and forecasting air quality. This can aid in public health planning, environmental policy-making, and public awareness.

## Technologies Used
- **R**: For statistical computing and graphics.
- **Tidyverse** and **dplyr**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **dbplyr**: For interacting with databases directly from R.
- **Caret**: For machine learning workflow.
- **RandomForest**: For predictive modeling.
- **Lubridate**: For easy date and time manipulation.
- **DBI** and **RSQLite**: For database connectivity and operations.

## Technical Aspect
This project demonstrates:
- Efficient data handling and manipulation with `tidyverse` and `dplyr`.
- Direct database interaction using `dbplyr` for scalable data processing.
- Application of the Random Forest algorithm for predictive modeling.
- Comprehensive data analysis, including trend identification and feature importance evaluation.

## Impact of This Project
The findings and predictive capabilities developed through this project have potential applications in environmental monitoring, public health advisories, and policy formulation to mitigate air pollution's adverse effects.
