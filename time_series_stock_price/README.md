## Overview
This project employs advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to forecast stock prices based on historical data. By analyzing time series data, we aim to build predictive models that can accurately forecast future movements in stock prices, providing valuable insights for investors and financial analysts.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to leverage the predictive power of data science in the financial market, enabling better investment decisions. Understanding and predicting stock market trends is crucial for risk management, portfolio optimization, and maximizing returns on investments.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing algorithms and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis, especially with time series data.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array manipulations.
- **Keras**: For building and training the LSTM neural network model.
- **TensorFlow**: As the backend engine for Keras.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing the stock price trends and model predictions.
- **Scikit-learn**: For preprocessing data and model evaluation.

## Technical Aspect
This project involves several key technical aspects, including:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling time series data, normalizing stock price values, and creating a structured dataset for training the model.
- **LSTM Neural Network**: Designing and training an LSTM model to capture the temporal dependencies and patterns in stock price movements.
- **Model Evaluation**: Using a hold-out validation set to evaluate the model's predictive accuracy and visualizing the model's performance in predicting stock prices against actual values.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Experimenting with different model architectures, batch sizes, and epochs to optimize performance.

## Impact of This Project
The Time Series Forecasting model for Stock Prices developed in this project can significantly impact the financial sector by:
- Providing investors and financial analysts with a powerful tool for forecasting stock prices, aiding in making informed investment decisions.
