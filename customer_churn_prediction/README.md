## Overview
This project develops a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churning. By analyzing customer data and their interactions with services, we aim to predict which customers are likely to discontinue their subscriptions, allowing businesses to take proactive measures.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to minimize customer churn by identifying at-risk customers early, enabling targeted customer retention strategies. Reducing churn rates can significantly impact a company's revenue and customer satisfaction levels.

## Technologies Used
- Python: For data manipulation and model building.
- Pandas: For data analysis and manipulation.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
- Numpy: For numerical computations.

## Technical Aspect
This project involves:
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model validation.
- Using RandomForestClassifier as the prediction model, with hyperparameter tuning performed via GridSearchCV.
- Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy and classification report metrics.

## Impact of This Project
The churn prediction model can significantly benefit businesses by:
- Identifying customers likely to churn, allowing for targeted retention efforts.
- Understanding key factors contributing to customer churn.
- Improving customer satisfaction and loyalty by addressing concerns proactively.
