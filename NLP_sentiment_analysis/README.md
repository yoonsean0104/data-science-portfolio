## Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on textual data, aiming to classify text as having a positive or negative sentiment. By analyzing customer reviews, social media posts, or any textual content, we can gain insights into the general sentiment towards products, services, or topics.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to understand customer sentiments, which can significantly impact business strategies, product development, and marketing campaigns. Sentiment analysis allows businesses to identify customer pain points, improve customer service, and enhance product offerings.

## Technologies Used
- Python: For processing and analyzing data.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning models and data preprocessing.
- NLTK: For natural language processing tasks, including stopwords removal and lemmatization.

## Technical Aspect
This project involves:
- Preprocessing textual data, including cleaning, tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatization.
- Converting text into a vectorized form using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction.
- Using Logistic Regression for classifying texts into positive or negative sentiments.
- Evaluating the model's performance through accuracy scores and classification reports.
