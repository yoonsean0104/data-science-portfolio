# NBA Player Performance Prediction Using Gradient Boosting

## Overview
This Python project focuses on predicting NBA players' total points in a given game using historical performance data. It incorporates advanced data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques, specifically a Gradient Boosting Regressor, to model and predict player performance.

## Motivation
Understanding and predicting player performance in the NBA can offer valuable insights for coaches, players, and fantasy sports enthusiasts. This project aims to leverage statistical analysis and machine learning to forecast game-by-game performance, aiding decision-making processes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing the prediction model and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model training, feature selection, and evaluation.

## Technical Aspect
This project includes:
- Detailed data preprocessing and manipulation to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Feature engineering to select and rank the most influential features affecting a player's total points.
- Training a Gradient Boosting Regressor model, known for its predictive accuracy and effectiveness in handling various data types.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R^2 Score.

## Impact of This Project
The predictive model developed through this project has the potential to revolutionize player performance analysis in the NBA, offering a quantitative tool for assessing future game performances and strategizing accordingly.
